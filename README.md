# Dock Wiki

## Contributing New Content

- Feel free to check out open [Issues](https://github.com/docknetwork/wiki/issues) first and submit a Pull Request to change or add content.
- If you don't find an open an Issue for what you're working on, submit a [new Issue](https://github.com/docknetwork/wiki/issues/new) for what you would like see changed.
- If you create a new page, you are the page "owner" and will be responsible for keeping it up to date. If mutually agreed upon, a new owner may be assigned. Owner name(s) should appear at the bottom of the page as `Owner: First Last (@github-username)`
- The maintainer will ask page owners to review proposed changes by third parties prior to merging.
- PRs that are not ready for review may use [draft pull requests](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/).
- Be sure to include references to Issues that are addressed by your PRs with descriptions like "Closes #1"

## Content Format

- All wiki pages must be submitted as standard markdown (.md) files in [/docs](https://github.com/docknetwork/wiki/tree/master/docs) without subfolders, more organization will be introduced as our page number grows.
- See [Mastering Markdown in GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for help with markdown formatting.
